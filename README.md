# UnlimitedEnchant
Allows you to modify the maximum level for all enchantments registered on your server, whether from vanilla, plugins, or data packs, without making a data pack.
This allows balancing enchantments as you see fit for your server by increasing and decreasing the maximum level of any enchantment.\
\
The name is a play on the "UNLIMITED POWER" meme.\
\
Some notes:
- The server must be restarted to apply config changes and when new enchantments are added with another plugin or data pack.
- Just because you *can* change the maximum level for another plugin's enchantments, does not mean you *should*. A plugin may not support levels above what exists by default.

## ⚠ WARNING ⚠
<ins>**DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE `/reload` OR PLUGMAN TO APPLY CHANGES.**</ins>\
I am not responsible for any problems you may cause by ignoring this warning, and any issues related to this will be closed.
